<P>

This page represents current thinking about where Mingw visual studio is going in the near, 
medium and long-term. It also serves as a schedule for new releases so
that both developers and users can know what to expect when, at least approximately.<P>

Note (1): as the Mingw visual studio effort is voluntary, these are not hard-and-fast deadlines:
but we will endeavour to follow them as closely as possible.<P><P>
